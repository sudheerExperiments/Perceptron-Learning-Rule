# Single neuron decision boundary using perceptron learning rule

>**Note: This project is submitted as part of class projects for CSE 5368 at University of Texas Arlington**

>**This code should not be used for the course CSE 5368 offered at University of Texas Arlington**

## System requirements:

* RAM: min 4GB

## Features:

* The project uses a random number generator to generate four random points in two classes.
* The neural network classifies the points into two classes(0 and 1) based on the perceptron learning rule.

## Setup and installation:

The following libraries are required to run this program.

> The project is tested using the below versions. It may or may not work with earlier or newer versions.

* Numpy v1.11
* Tk Inter v8.5.18

I recommend to use anaconda library to make life simpler instead of installing those libraries manually to deploy this project.

## Download links:

* [Anaconda library](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

## Description:

* *Input Weight 1*, *Input Weight 2* and *Bias* are used to select desired weights.
* *Generate* button generates four random points in two classes.
* *Train* button displays generated decision boundary.

## Deployment:

1. Run **Raja_01_01** program.
